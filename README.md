Calculator app for Assignment 2: My First App

UI inspired from system calculator app of iPhone.

Some important notes:
1. The operations Sin, square root, cube root and log, will be performed on the total calculated value instead of a single number. So you need to enter the number before pressing the buttons to calculate Sin, square root, cube root, or log

Screenshot attached below for reference.
